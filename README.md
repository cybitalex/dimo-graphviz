Building out a graph of all companies developing robotaxi services.

## Features

- **GraphQL API**: All nodes shown the application are sourced from the DIMO GraphQL API, so users can endlessly traverse the relationships within our database.
- [**G6**](https://github.com/antvis/g6): We use a hyper-modern graph visualization engine built in javascript and typescript.
- **Clean UX and UI**: The graph is intuitive and easy to use - load in some data and try it yourself!


## Upcoming

- **Elastic Search**: Users will be able to search through our data with incredible recall and precision.
- **Advanced node grouping** (with animations) - keep large graphs fast and organized
- **React** into application to enable dynamic
- **Spatial features** Load an SVG in background to link objects to geo-locations, or to enforce a structure on your graphs.
- **Creating/editing nodes** - Push your changes back to DIMO databse. You'll be able to visually edit the graph, and generate Proposals, RFPs, and [Project] templates. 
- Improved undo/redo functionality
