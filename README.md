## Features

- **GraphQL API**: All nodes shown the application are sourced from our very own GraphQL API, so users can endlessly traverse the relationships within our database.
- [**G6**](https://github.com/antvis/g6): We use a hyper-modern graph visualization engine built in javascript and typescript.
- **UX and UI**: We intend to build an application that is intuitive and easy to use.
- (Upcoming)**Elastic Search**: Users will be able to search through our data with incredible recall and precision.

4. UI/UX for creating/editing nodes, and push changes back to databse.
5. Fixing undo/redo to work intuitively.
