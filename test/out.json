Since then, responders have been working to remove the ship in sections to send the hulk to the scrapper. November was particularly exciting, as workers used a chain to cut off the first enormous chunk of ship, revealing mangled cars within. Here\u2019s a look at the fascinating way the team pulled this off.\n\n",

Think of us as a mix between a \u201cgas station\u201d and gated parking where you can charge up your escooter, ebike or autonomous delivery robot and feel safe knowing your shared or owned vehicle is locked. We enable shared fleets to be more organized and reliably charged, eliminating dreaded scooter clutter from the streets. Our hubs are proudly designed and manufactured in Flint, MI.\n\nJust like how escooters and ebikes are shared, our charging infrastructure is also shared to allow for accessible power for escooters, ebikes, eskateboards and autonomous delivery robots. We are the pioneers of Flexible Docking, and enable your fleet to be a hybrid of dockless and docked systems. Coming to a city near you!\n\n\n",

The tools we already use in and of themselves are very good, but they do not work seamlessly with one another simply because they were never designed to work with each other. This is an industry-wide issue. It slows us all down in the race to automated driving. It costs money and precious resources to reduce the problem to a manageable level.

We are a group of graduate students, engineers, and researchers who specialise in Environment Perception and Autonomous Navigation, in particular for autonomous driving under complex and dynamic urban environments.\n\nLeveraging techniques from multisensor fusion, computer vision, and machine learning, our group is actively pursuing research in dynamic scene understanding, object detection and tracking, precise localization, vehicle control, and path planning. We are continuously involved in various collaborative research projects with other academic and industry partners, funded by the European Commission (Horizon 2020), the French National Research Agency (ANR), the State-Region (CPER), among others. Our joint facilities include dedicated autonomous vehicle research laboratories, an experimental arena, and a fleet of diverse autonomous vehicles.\n\nPlease take a look at our research papers (IEEE Transactions, ITSC, IV, ICRA, IROS, IJCAI, ECAI, AAMAS, etc.), watch a few videos of our autonomous car in action, and peruse some media coverage about our work and our group. Let us know if you have any questions or comments!",

SuperCell uses taller towers and high-gain, narrow-sectored antennas to increase mobile data range and capacity. Their field measurements found that a 36-sector SuperCell base station mounted on a 250-meter tower can serve a geographical coverage area up to 65 times larger than a standard three-sector rural macro base station on a 30-meter tower in the same topography. A SuperCell can replace 15-25 sites, and that resulted in about 33% lower total cost of ownership from the point of view of the mobile network operator that would want to cover that same area with alternative means.",

In addition to LiDAR, which uses invisible laser beams to build a view of the surrounding environment, and GPS for localization, the two NAVYA Autonom Shuttles were equipped with on-board cameras and Wi-Fi communications to capture data generated during operation.",

SuperCell uses taller towers and high-gain, narrow-sectored antennas to increase mobile data range and capacity. Their field measurements found that a 36-sector SuperCell base station mounted on a 250-meter tower can serve a geographical coverage area up to 65 times larger than a standard three-sector rural macro base station on a 30-meter tower in the same topography. A SuperCell can replace 15-25 sites, and that resulted in about 33% lower total cost of ownership from the point of view of the mobile network operator that would want to cover that same area with alternative means.",

Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis. U-Haul co-founders L.S. \"Sam\" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.",

MaaS is a way to integrate different transportation options in order to facilitate coordinating trip and route planning, mode selection, and payment, according to Andy Boenau, leader of the MaaS initiative at engineering consulting firm Stantec.\n\nHow can different localities think about the implementation of Maas? A 2018 study by Jana Sochor et al. describes four levels of implementing MaaS. Level one includes multimodal planners, of which Google Maps is a rudimentary example; level two integrates booking and paying; level three has many layers, integrating a complete multimodal trip; and level four integrates policy goals, such as congestion charging. \n\nSochor et al. point to \u201cthe need for decarbonization of the transport system, reduced congestion, innovation, and better accessibility\u201d as important societal goals achieving a high level of MaaS will enable.",

While SpaceX eventually hopes to have as many as 12,000 satellites in this so-called megaconstellation, the size and scale of the project have flustered astronomers and amateur skywatchers, who fear that the bright, orbiting objects will interfere with observations of the universe. \n\nThe initial plan\nSpaceX's satellite internet proposal was announced in January 2015. Though it wasn't given a name at the time, CEO Elon Musk said that the company had filed documents with international regulators to place about 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\n\"We're really talking about something which is, in the long term, like rebuilding the internet in space,\" Musk said during a speech in Seattle when revealing the project.",

MaaS is a way to integrate different transportation options in order to facilitate coordinating trip and route planning, mode selection, and payment, according to Andy Boenau, leader of the MaaS initiative at engineering consulting firm Stantec.\n\nHow can different localities think about the implementation of Maas? A 2018 study by Jana Sochor et al. describes four levels of implementing MaaS. Level one includes multimodal planners, of which Google Maps is a rudimentary example; level two integrates booking and paying; level three has many layers, integrating a complete multimodal trip; and level four integrates policy goals, such as congestion charging. \n\nSochor et al. point to \u201cthe need for decarbonization of the transport system, reduced congestion, innovation, and better accessibility\u201d as important societal goals achieving a high level of MaaS will enable.",

Traffic in the park has gone up almost 40% over the last 12 years. This caused traffic jams, erosion, damage to vegetation, and trash problems at busy restrooms. The park service is looking at alternatives to private vehicles to solve these problems.\n\nJoe Moye, Beep CEO, said in a press release that Yellowstone's Visitor Use Management Program aligns with Beep's mission to provide alternative, sustainable, and innovative transportation solutions meant to improve mobility.

No matter how large a city grows, more levels can always be added. \n\nCreated by Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, The Boring Company (TBC) constructs safe, fast-to-dig, and low-cost transportation, utility, and freight tunnels.

Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight, and won't fall on your head. A large network of tunnels many levels deep would help alleviate congestion in any city. No matter how large a city grows, more levels can always be added. \n\nCreated by Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, The Boring Company (TBC) constructs safe, fast-to-dig, and low-cost transportation, utility, and freight tunnels. Our public transportation solution, Loop, is designed to be the fastest and safest system ever.",

Activity and media coverage has been widespread in recent years and will continue to intensify.  Point One has taken a practical approach to the market, realizing that applications with full automation will take years to launch.  For some OEMs, gradual advancement toward autonomy is desired.  Point One\u2019s solutions are enabling customers who embrace this strategy, beginning with applications that require a transition from Level 2 to 3, and then beyond.  These programs are being readied now for deployment as soon as calendar year 2020 on the Polaris and FusionEngine platforms.  Other OEMs prefer to wait until affordable Level 4 or higher systems are available.  For this group, we are currently running pilots based on the V-MAP platform to support the highest levels of autonomy.",

A&T) are evaluating whether an automated shuttle system could improve public transportation access for vulnerable road users, such as the elderly and people with disabilities. Those who depend on public transportation often face the challenge of how they will travel from transit endpoints, such as bus stops, to their homes and destinations. This is called the \u201cFirst Mile/Last Mile Problem\u201d in the transportation industry. For individuals with accessibility needs or other challenges, an additional transportation method is needed to bridge the gap.",

While SpaceX eventually hopes to have as many as 12,000 satellites in this so-called megaconstellation, the size and scale of the project have flustered astronomers and amateur skywatchers, who fear that the bright, orbiting objects will interfere with observations of the universe. \n\nThe initial plan\nSpaceX's satellite internet proposal was announced in January 2015. Though it wasn't given a name at the time, CEO Elon Musk said that the company had filed documents with international regulators to place about 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\n\"We're really talking about something which is, in the long term, like rebuilding the internet in space,\" Musk said during a speech in Seattle when revealing the project.",
